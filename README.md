## 1. Time Complexity

Time complexity is a concept in computer science that deals with the quantification of the amount of time taken by a set of code or algorithm to process or run as a function of the amount of input. In other words, time complexity is essentially efficiency, or how long a program function takes to process a given input.

## 2. Arrays

An array is a static data structure that stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.

## 3. Singly Linked List

A singly linked list is a type of data structure that is made up of nodes that are created using self referential structures. Each node contains data and a pointer to the next node in the list.

## 4. Doubly Linked List

A Doubly Linked List (DLL) contains an extra pointer, typically called previous pointer, together with next pointer and data which are there in singly linked list.

## 5. Singly Circular Linked List

A circular singly linked list is a type of linked list in which last node points to the first node making the whole linked list a circle.

## 6. Stacks

A stack is a linear data structure that stores items in a Last-In/First-Out (LIFO) or First-In/Last-Out (FILO) manner. In stack, a new element is added at one end and an element is removed from that end only.

## 7. Queues

A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first.

## 8. Recursion

Recursion is a programming and mathematical concept where a function calls itself during its execution. Instead of solving a problem directly, a recursive function solves a smaller instance of the same problem and combines the results to obtain the final solution. This technique is particularly useful when a problem can be broken down into smaller, more manageable subproblems.
